üîÅ FLOW EXPLAINED STEP BY STEP:
document.querySelectorAll('.star')

Selects all elements with class star (i.e., 5 stars).

Returns a NodeList (like an array) of those <span> elements.

stars.forEach(function(star) { ... })

This loops over each element in the NodeList.

For each loop, the individual element is passed as the argument star.

Callback Function

function(star) { ... } is a callback function.

It is called once for each star in the NodeList.

star is just a variable name representing the current star element in the loop.

Inside the Callback:

Adds a click event listener to each star.

When clicked:

It gets the value from data-value (1 to 5).

Calls updateRating(value) to fill/unfill stars based on selection.

üîÑ Example Walkthrough:
Let‚Äôs say the user clicks the third star:

That star has: data-value="3"

In the loop, star is the third <span>

value = 3

updateRating(3) is called

Inside updateRating, we loop again and:

Fill all stars with data-value <= 3 by adding the "filled" class

Remove "filled" from others
