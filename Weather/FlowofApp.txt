Yes, without console.log, the function getTemp("Chicago") will still return a Promise because the function itself is asynchronous and contains an await statement.

Here's how it works:
The function getTemp() is asynchronous because it's declared with async. This means that it always returns a Promise, regardless of whether you log anything or not.

The await keyword is used to pause execution until the asynchronous operation (in this case, fetch) resolves. After fetch completes, it returns a Response object which is then parsed into JSON, and that parsed data is returned from the function.

The returned Promise from getTemp("Chicago") will resolve with the parsed weather data when the API request is completed.

However, without console.log in your code:

You won't see the data logged to the console, but the promise will still be there, and you can consume it later using .then() or await.

The function will always return a Promise because it is async.

Without console.log, the Promise is still returned, but you wonâ€™t see the output directly in the console unless you explicitly consume it using .then() or await.
